  <h2 class="pageTitle">Round One </h2>
    <p class="instructions">In this round each player will choose which other player they wish to form an alliance with. <br> <br>

        If each player is chosen by another then no alliance will be formed, and each player's contribution to the game prize will be returned. <br><br>
        
        If two players choose to form an alliance, then the other player shall be eliminated. However, this does not mean that the eliminated player can't still win the game prize! <br><br>
        
        Players can discuss their decisions before making them. You can tell the truth about your intentions or lie. Whichever you think is best! 
        <br><br>
        However, players must make their decisions OUT OF SIGHT of the other players!
