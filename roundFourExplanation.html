    <p class="instructions">This round will be a re-run of Round Two with the previously eliminated players being brought back into the game. 
      <br><br>
      Each player will choose which other remaining player they wish to form an alliance with.  
      <br><br>
      If each player is chosen by another then no alliance will be formed, and the game prize will be split between the three remaining players. 
      <br><br>
      If two players choose to form an alliance, then the other player shall be eliminated. Again, depending on what happens this player may re-enter the game. 
      <br><br>
      Players can discuss their decisions before making them. You can tell the truth about your intentions or lie. Whichever you think is best! However, players must make their decision OUT OF SIGHT of the other players!
