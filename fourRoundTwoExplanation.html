    <p class="instructions">In this round each remaining player will choose which other remaining player they wish to form an alliance with. <br> <br>

        If each player is chosen by another then no alliance will be formed, and the game prize will be split between the three remaining players. <br><br>
        
        If two players choose to form an alliance, then the other player shall be eliminated. Again, depending on what happens this player may re-enter the game. <br><br>
        
        Players can discuss their decisions before making them. You can tell the truth about your intentions or lie. Whichever you think is best! 
        <br><br>
        However, players must make their decision OUT OF SIGHT of the other players!
