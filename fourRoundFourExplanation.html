    <p class="instructions">This round will be a re-run of Round Three with the two previosuly eliminated players being brought back into the game as an alliance. Both players will be given the choice to remain loyal to this alliance or to betray it. 
      <br><br>
      If both players remain loyal to their alliance, then they shall both be declared joint winners and shall split the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If one player chooses to betray the alliance while the other chooses to remain loyal then the betrayer wins and shall keep all of the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If both players betray the alliance, then both shall be permanently eliminated and will lose their secondary contributions to the game prize and
    
      and a winner shall be selected at random from all of the orginal players.
