    <p class="instructions">In this round both remaining players will be given the choice to remain loyal to their alliance or to betray it. 
      <br><br>
      If both players remain loyal to their alliance, then they shall both be declared joint winners and shall split the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If one player chooses to betray the alliance while the other chooses to remain loyal then the betrayer wins and shall keep all of the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If both players betray the alliance, then both shall be permanently eliminated and will lose their secondary contributions which will go into the game prize.
      <br><br>
      The three previously eliminated players shall re-enter the game to play for the game prize.
      <br><br>  
      Again, players are free to discuss their intentions but are not allowed to see each other make their choices!</p>
