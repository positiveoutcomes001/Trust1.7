    <p class="instructions">In this round both remaining players will be given the choice to remain loyal to their alliance or to betray it. 
      <br><br>
      If both players remain loyal to their alliance, then they shall both be declared joint winners and shall split the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If one player chooses to betray the alliance while the other chooses to remain loyal then the betrayer wins and shall keep all of the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      If both players betray the alliance, then both shall be permanently eliminated and will lose their secondary contributions to the game prize. 
      The previously eliminated player shall win the game and take the game prize. 
      <br><br>
      Again, players are free to discuss their intentions but are not allowed to see the each other make their choices!
